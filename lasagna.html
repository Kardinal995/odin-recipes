    <h2>Description</h2>


    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck.
        It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.

        Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna, which he has been cooking since his
        college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted
        here will easily serve eight people.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>


    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>Steps</h2>


    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil:</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
        <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef</li>
        <li>Make the sauce</li>
        <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna</li>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <li>Cool and serve</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
